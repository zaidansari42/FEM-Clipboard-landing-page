## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to create a beautiful website with only HTML & CSS. And how to move an image out of the container box and adjust items according to the width of the device it's been viewed on.

```html
<div class="intro">
  <h2>Access Clipboard anywhere</h2>
  <p>
    Whether youâ€™re on the go, or at your computer, you can access all your
    Clipboard snippets in a few simple clicks.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 960px) {
  .device img,
  .pc img {
    width: 95%;
  }
}
```
